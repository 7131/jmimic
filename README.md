# Juggling Simulator Impersonators

https://7131.github.io/jmimic/

These are simulator examples using the [jmotion](https://github.com/7131/jmotion/) library.
With the jmotion, anyone can create original juggling simulators.

Since the jmotion uses HTML &lt;svg&gt; tags, knowledge of SVG images is required to change the look of the simulator.
For now, it is sufficient to know the &lt;line&gt;, &lt;path&gt;, and &lt;use&gt; tags.
